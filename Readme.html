The preventDefault() and stopPropagation() methods in Javascript event handling serve distinct purposes related to event behavior in the DOM. 

* event.preventDefault() :- 
Prevens the browser's default behavior for a specific event.Does not affect event propagation . The event will still bubble up to parent elements and trigger any listeners ther.

* event stopPropagation():- 
This method halts the propagtion of an event through the DOM hierarchy. The "flow" of the event through the DOM hierarchy.
